        <h4><u>Problem Statement</u></h4>
        Template matching is a technique in digital image processing for finding small parts of an image which match a template image.
        For my experiments, the image to be searched was taken as 67 Megapixel image (8192 X 8192) and template image was taken to be
        256 pixels (16 X 16). The goal was to locate an approximate match of the small matrix in the bigger one as fast as possible. <br/>

        <br/>The criteria for a match being found was:
        <ol>
        <li>Smaller picture should be set a subset of a larger one with each pixel of smaller picture be within the +/-20% range of the corresponding subset pixel of the larger one: <code> 0.8*Big_Pixel &lt; Small_Pixel &lt; 1.2*Big_Pixel.</code></li>
        <li>At least 50% of the pixels in the smaller image should match the above criteria.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h4>Implementation details</h4>
        The solution was tested on 40 core nehalem machine. For simplicity, the pixels were assumed to be in range of 0-128.<br/>
        I had used pthreads, and the big and small matrices were shared across threads.<br/>
        The code for the same can be <a href='codes/matrixSearch.cc.txt'>found here</a>.<br/><br/>
        The flow was :<br/><br/>

        <pre>
        Parent Thread           Children-threads
        -----------------------------------------
        Read-small-matrix           -

                                Read big matrix in parallel. The input read was stored in big_low
             -                  and big_high matrices, so as to prevent floating point multiplications when we
                                perform the search.

            Wait till all children threads are done.

             -                  Perform the search, Make use of 128 bit registers.
                                one 128 bit register can perform 16 8-bit integer operations at once.
                                (Makes the search 16x faster.)

            Done
        </pre><br/><br/>
        The best result was found with 40 threads (one per core). The matrices were accessed so as to take advantage of spatial
        locality and minimize cache-misses. Some additional optimizations I had put in were not to continue
        search if more than 50% pixels don't satisfy the matching criteria (had a significant impact on runtime) and while populating
        big_high and big_low, use precalculated values for <code>1.2*num </code> and <code>0.8*num</code> (had minimal impact), may be
        because with -O3 enabled, g++ was already doing something similar.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
