            I list here in chronological order some of the projects I started. Most of them are in very early stages due to time constraints and the fact that I especially enjoy exploring technologies that are new to me.
            
            <ul id='project_list'>
            <li /> (2013) A website to help you organize items from kijiji visually. The particular implementation is specific to car ads -- as that is what I was buying at the time when I felt a need for such a service. Scheduling meetings all over town with car owners without being visually aware of the locations of these cars proved to be surprisingly inefficient. In the <a href="http://cars.is-best.net/">current implementation</a> we can give the program a link to a kijiji car ad and it will be displayed on the map with a summary of information about the car. UPDATE: it seems kijiji may have changed their site structure since, and thus my scraping code fails to recover the required data. Will update.
            <span class='tech_used'>php, (my)sql, ajax, html+css</span>
            <li /> (2013) A website for my spiderweb-relocation service, <a href="http://spidysense.is-great.net/">SpidySense</a>. Not to be taken too seriously :)
            <span class='tech_used'>html+css, 3 lines of javascript</span>
            <li /> (2013) As coursework, I wrote a program that would take motion capture animation files of humans doing flips, dancing, etc., match the skeleton up to the 3D mesh of a human automatically, and bring the originally static model to life. <a href="https://github.com/szepi1991/cmput411-assignment3">Link.</a> 
            <span class='tech_used'>C++, OpenGL</span>
            <li /> (2012) I experimted with Android a little. In particular I was interested in writing games; after some research I decided to work with AndEngine. While experimenting and messing around, I transcribed some of my findings on a rather disorganized <a href="http://andventurez.blogspot.ca/">blog</a>. 
            <span class='tech_used'>Java, Android SDK, AndEngine, Box2D</span>
            <li /> (2012) I spent some months during the summer writing tools for a researcher in mathematics. The tools were mostly doing exhaustive searches in certain spaces, with sets of provable hueristics, which were also partially automatically computed. I invested a large amount of time into cleaning, commenting, and modularizing over 10000 lines of spaghetti code inherited from the previous intern.
            <span class='tech_used'>Java, JUnit, Multithreading, GUI programming</span>
            <li /> (2011). For a Machine Learning course in a class competition my SVM based classifier ranked 3rd in identifying hand written characters. With a group of students we also investigated the possibility of using machine learning algorithms for daily stock price movement predictions.
            <span class='tech_used'>Matlab, Machine Learning</span>
            <li /> (2010?). Implementing a computer player for the board game of Quoridor. The agent uses the popular reinforcement learning algorithm UCT.
            <span class='tech_used'>Java, UCT</span>
            <li /> (Junior High). With some friends from Hungary we formed the game dev team N2G: New Generation Games, and worked on a collection of games. One of our games won an award in a Hungarian National Computer Contest for Ages Under 19, and also became a staff pick on the (at the time up-and-coming) YoYoGames website. For an exhaustive list of projects with images and short line descriptions, see <a href="http://n2g.uw.hu/proj.php">this page</a>, left under construction.
            <span class='tech_used'>Game Maker</span>
            <li /> (Elementary School) I started learning Pascal and Comenius Logo at this age.
