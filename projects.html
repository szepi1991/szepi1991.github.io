                <h3>Medley - Netflix Search</h3>
                <div>
                    For "Hack the North" hosted at the University of Waterloo with my friends we started building a website that allows for convenient searching of Netflix movies, as this proved to be difficult in our experience. In particular, you often want to consult imdb or rotten tomatoes on top of basic categorical searches. Our website does exactly that and more. Check it out <a href="http://medleymovies.me/">here</a>.

                <h3>A script to extract information from weekly seminar updates (2013)</h3>
                <div>
                    I wrote a google script that takes my school's not-so-well-formatted weekly talk & seminar updates, extracts and pushes all information into a google calendar for my (and anyone else's) viewing pleasure. At that point it is rather simple copying the events that I am interested in into my personal calendar.

                <div>
                    I prototyped a website that helps you visually organize items from kijiji. The particular implementation is specific to car ads, as that was my personal motivation at the time; Scheduling meetings all over town with vehicle owners, without being aware of the locational distribution of these cars, proved to be surprisingly inefficient. In the <a href="http://cars.is-best.net/">current implementation</a> we can give the program a link to a kijiji car ad and it will be saved onto a map, along with a summary of information about the car. UPDATE: it seems kijiji may have changed their site structure since then, and thus my scraping code fails to recover the required data. Will update.

                <div>
                    For a computer graphics course, I wrote a program that would take motion capture animation files of humans doing flips, dancing, etc., match the skeleton up to the 3D mesh of a human automatically (placing the skeleton inside the body was done by hand), and bring the originally static model to life. <a href="https://github.com/szepi1991/cmput411-assignment3">Link.</a>

                <h3>Android Game Dev Experimentation (2012)</h3>
                <div>
                    I was curious how to make apps for Android. In particular I was interested in writing games; after some research I decided to work with AndEngine. While messing around, I transcribed some of my findings into a rather disorganized <a href="http://andventurez.blogspot.ca/">blog</a>.

                <h3>Writing utility programs for Mathematics research (2012)</h3>
                <div>
                    I spent some months during the summer writing tools for a researcher in mathematics. The tools were mostly doing exhaustive searches in certain spaces, with sets of provable hueristics, which were also partially automatically computed. I invested a large amount of time into cleaning, commenting, and modularizing over 10000 lines of spaghetti code inherited from the previous intern.

                <div>
                    In my Machine Learning course my SVM based classifier ranked 3rd in a class competition at identifying hand written characters. <br />
                    With a group of students we also investigated the possibility of using machine learning algorithms for daily stock price movement predictions.

                    I was implementing a computer player for the board game of Quoridor. The agent uses the popular reinforcement learning algorithm UCT. The initial part of the work was joint with <a href="http://www.jessederektucker.com">Jesse Tucker</a>.

                    For a research project I was implementing various algorithms hoping they will reduce the search space involved in solving Sokoban puzzles. I displayed this extra information as an overlay on a Sokoban game implementation, and found a counterexample to the proposed methods.

                <div>
                    After learning about evolution in biology class, I was inspired to write a program where creatures learnt an approximate shortest path to a mating area.  The creatures who got there faster could mate for longer and thus pass on their mutated DNA, which was an encoding of the path they took, more dominantly. As a result, through natural selection, the creatures found an approximate shortest path to the mating area, and could even adapt to changes in its location.

                    With some friends from Hungary we formed the game dev team N2G: New Generation Games, and worked on a collection of games. One of our games won an award in a Hungarian National Computer Contest for Ages Under 19, and also became a staff pick on the (at the time up-and-coming) YoYoGames website. For an exhaustive list of projects with images and short descriptions, see <a href="http://n2g.uw.hu/proj.php">this page</a>, left under construction.
